# scripts

Repository for various scripts I make.

#### binfind.sh

Searches for binary files based from the value of `$PATH`.

#### init/build-and-copy.sh

A script I ended up making to automate building of my custom initrd.

#### libfind.sh

Searches for library files in `/lib`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/local/lib` and other paths found in `/etc/ld.so.conf`.

#### manfind.sh

Searches for manual pages based from `$MANPATH`.

#### notepad++.sh

I use this wrapper script to easily run wine-emulated Notepad++.

#### rcopy.sh

Copies files along with their dependencies to a virtual root directory.  The resulting file's path is reproduced based from its source.
